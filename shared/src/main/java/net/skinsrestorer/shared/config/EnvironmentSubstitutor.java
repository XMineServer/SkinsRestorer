// XMine start - подстановка переменных среды
/**
 * Expands environment variable references such as {@code ${DB_HOST}} inside configuration values.
 *
 * <p>This is a port of {@code io.papermc.paper.configuration.EnvironmentSubstitutor} from the XMine
 * Paper fork, kept deliberately identical in behaviour. A game node reads most plugin configs
 * through Bukkit's {@code YamlConfiguration}, which carries that class; SkinsRestorer reads its own
 * through ConfigMe and never touches it, so without this copy the same server would have two
 * different substitution dialects. It is a copy rather than a dependency because this plugin also
 * runs on Velocity and BungeeCord, where paper-api does not exist.
 *
 * <h2>Syntax</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code ${NAME}} - replaced by the value of the environment variable {@code NAME}.
 *     If the variable is <em>not set</em>, the reference is left in place verbatim. If it is
 *     set but empty, it expands to the empty string.</li>
 *     <li>{@code ${NAME:-fallback}} - replaced by the value of {@code NAME} when it is set and
 *     non-empty, and by {@code fallback} otherwise. This mirrors the POSIX shell operator of the
 *     same name, including its treatment of an empty value as "not set". The fallback text is
 *     itself expanded, so {@code ${A:-${B:-none}}} works.</li>
 *     <li>{@code $${NAME}} - an escape: expands to the literal text {@code ${NAME}} and the
 *     variable is never looked up.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Why these rules</h2>
 * Configuration files that exist today were written without any knowledge of this feature, and
 * silently corrupting one is far worse than failing to expand a reference somebody wanted
 * expanded: a missed expansion is visible in the config and trivially diagnosed, a wrong one
 * shows up as a plugin misbehaving weeks later. Every ambiguous case is therefore resolved in
 * favour of leaving the text alone:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Names are upper case only</b> ({@code [A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*}). Environment variables are
 *     upper case by universal convention (POSIX, Docker, systemd, 12-factor); placeholders that
 *     plugins define for themselves are overwhelmingly lower case ({@code ${player}},
 *     {@code ${skin}}). Restricting the name charset costs nothing real and removes most of the
 *     collision surface at a stroke.</li>
 *     <li><b>An unset variable is left as written</b>, rather than expanding to the empty string
 *     or throwing. An empty string turns "the operator forgot to set DATABASE_PASSWORD" into a
 *     confusing authentication failure elsewhere. Leaving {@code ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}} in place
 *     makes the mistake self-describing - the plugin then fails to log in with a literal
 *     {@code ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}} as its password, which names its own cause. Use
 *     {@code ${NAME:-}} to ask for an empty string explicitly.</li>
 *     <li><b>{@code $$} is the escape</b>, matching Docker Compose, rather than a backslash.
 *     A backslash would have to survive YAML's own escaping inside double-quoted scalars, which
 *     is exactly the kind of rule nobody gets right the first time.</li>
 *     <li><b>Substituted values are never rescanned.</b> If {@code A=${B}} then {@code ${A}}
 *     expands to the four characters {@code ${B}}, not to the value of {@code B}. This rules out
 *     both expansion loops and an injection where the content of one variable reaches into
 *     another.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Logging</h2>
 * This class never logs, and never places a variable's value into an exception message. Secrets
 * are the main reason to reach for this feature at all, so nothing here may leak one.
